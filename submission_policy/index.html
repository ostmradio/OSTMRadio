                  <h3>Submission Policy — OSTM LTD</h3>
                  <p>This Submission Policy explains the terms under which Artists (“you”, “your”) may submit music or related content to OSTM LTD (“OSTM Radio”, “we”, “us”, “our”). By submitting your music through ostm.co.uk/publish/ or by any approved method, you agree to the conditions outlined in this policy. These terms form a legally binding agreement between you and OSTM LTD.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h3>Last Updated: 10 November 2025</h3>
                  <p>If we update this policy, the revised version will be published on this page. However, the version active at the time of your submission will remain the governing agreement for that submission.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h3>Who We Are</h3>
                  <h4>Controller</h4>
                  <p><strong>OSTM LTD</strong><br>United Kingdom<br>Email: <a href="mailto:admin@ostm.co.uk">admin@ostm.co.uk</a></p>
                  <br>

                  <h3>Eligibility to Submit</h3>
                  <p>By submitting music to OSTM LTD, you confirm that you are the rightful owner of the music or have full legal permission from the rights-holder to grant us the licence outlined in this policy. You also confirm that you are authorised to enter this agreement and that all information provided in the submission form is accurate. Submissions must be made by individuals who own or control the rights to the music being submitted.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
                  <p>You must provide accurate information through the submission form, including your artist name, contact email, music links or files, cover art, song titles, genre, details regarding ownership of rights, and a typed signature acknowledging agreement with this policy. All information provided must be true and complete. We collect and store all submission data, including names, emails, links, and song information, for administrative and operational purposes.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h3>Licence You Grant to OSTM LTD</h3>
                  <p>When you submit music, you grant OSTM LTD a <strong>non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, and perpetual licence</strong> to use your music across all our services. This includes the rights to broadcast your music live on OSTM Radio, include it in replays and on-demand archives, use it in podcasts or recorded shows, create promotional clips, use it in trailers or advertisements, and publish it across all OSTM LTD–owned platforms and brands. This licence allows us to use your music without seeking further permission or paying licensing fees.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h3>Ownership of Your Music</h3>
                  <p>You retain full ownership of your music. Submitting your music does not transfer ownership to OSTM LTD. You simply grant us the rights necessary to broadcast, promote, and use your music as described in this policy.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h3>Withdrawal of Your Music</h3>
                  <p>You may request that we stop using your music at any time by contacting <a href="mailto:admin@ostm.co.uk">admin@ostm.co.uk</a>. Once a withdrawal request is received, OSTM LTD has up to two weeks to cease further broadcasts and future use of your music. However, materials created prior to withdrawal—such as past broadcasts, archives, or promotional clips—will remain unchanged and may continue to exist but will not be newly reused.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h3>Content Restrictions</h3>
                  <p>Submitted music must be suitable for broadcast. We accept English-language content only. Explicit content is allowed, but OSTM LTD may apply censoring or editing when necessary for broadcast safety or compliance. Sensitive or political content may be accepted but may be subject to removal or modification as needed.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h3>Technical Edits and Metadata</h3>
                  <p>OSTM LTD may make technical adjustments to your music, such as volume balancing, minor mastering changes, or radio-safe censoring. We may also correct metadata (such as spelling errors) without seeking additional approval. These changes are made to ensure appropriate broadcast quality and listener experience.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h3>Monetisation</h3>
                  <p>Your music may appear in content that is monetised by OSTM LTD, including live broadcasts, replays, clips, or promotional material. You grant us permission to monetise such content through advertising, sponsorships, or other revenue processes. You will not be entitled to royalties or payments unless a separate written agreement is established.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h3>Where Your Music May Appear</h3>
                  <p>Your music may be broadcast on OSTM Radio, used in replay services, included in podcast or recorded content, featured in promotional materials, and published across our websites, apps, and OSTM LTD–owned brands. Streaming metadata may publicly display your artist name and track title as standard.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h3>Submission Method</h3>
                  <p>All music must be submitted through <strong>ostm.co.uk/publish/</strong>. Email submissions may be redirected to this form. We aim to ensure that all submissions follow the same structured process for tracking, review, and approval.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h3>Data Handling</h3>
                  <p>We collect and store all information that you submit, including your name, contact details, song links, cover art, and any other associated data. This information is stored securely and used solely for managing your submission, broadcasting your music, and maintaining our services. We do not sell or share your submission data.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h3>No Guarantee of Airplay</h3>
                  <p>Submitting music does not guarantee acceptance or broadcast. OSTM LTD reserves the right to approve or decline any submission at our discretion. Reasons may include quality control, legal concerns, broadcast safety, or operational requirements.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h3>Removal by OSTM LTD</h3>
                  <p>OSTM LTD may remove your music from broadcast or future use at any time if it violates guidelines, generates legal issues, contains harmful content, or no longer aligns with our operational needs. Removal does not affect previously created broadcasts or archived content.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h3>Legal Responsibility and Indemnity</h3>
                  <p>By submitting music, you acknowledge that you are responsible for ensuring that your submission does not infringe upon any copyrights or third-party rights. If OSTM LTD faces a copyright claim, dispute, or legal issue as a result of your submission, you agree to indemnify and hold us harmless for all associated costs, damages, and liabilities. This requirement exists because you are confirming ownership or authorisation when submitting your music.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h3>Disputes and Legal Jurisdiction</h3>
                  <p>We aim to resolve all issues informally first. If escalation is necessary, all disputes related to your submission or this policy will fall under the jurisdiction of the courts of England, and will be governed by the applicable laws of the United Kingdom.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h3>Acceptance of This Policy</h3>
                  <p>By submitting the form on ostm.co.uk/publish/ and providing your typed signature, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to the Submission Policy. Your submission and signature form a binding agreement between you and OSTM LTD. If your submission is approved and broadcast, this further confirms your acceptance of the terms.</p>
