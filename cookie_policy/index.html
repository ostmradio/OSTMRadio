                  <p>This Cookie Policy explains how OSTM LTD (“OSTM Radio”, “we”, “us”, “our”) uses cookies and similar technologies on ostm.co.uk.
                      It should be read together with our Privacy Policy. We operate under the laws of the United Kingdom and comply with the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Last Updated: 10 November 2025</h3>
                  <p>We will update this policy when new tools, ads, or integrations are added that rely on cookies or similar tracking technologies.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>What Are Cookies?</h3>
                  <p>Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit a website. They are used for remembering preferences,
                      analysing website traffic, or delivering personalised content and advertisements.</p>
                  <p>We do not set cookies directly from ostm.co.uk. However, some third-party services we use may place their own cookies when their scripts or content load on our pages.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Cookies We Do Not Use</h3>
                  <p>OSTM LTD does <strong>not</strong> use:</p>
                  <p>
                      - First-party cookies for analytics<br>
                      - First-party cookies for tracking<br>
                      - First-party cookies for user accounts or login sessions<br>
                      - Advertising cookies placed directly by us
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Cookies Used by Third Parties</h3>
                  <p>Although OSTM LTD does not set cookies directly, the following third-party services used on our website may do so when they operate:</p>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Google Services (Ads, Analytics, and Measurement Tools)</h4>
                  <p>
                      When Google AdSense, Google Analytics, or related Google tools are active, Google may place cookies on your device for:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      - Ad personalisation (if permitted)<br>
                      - Measurement and reporting<br>
                      - Fraud prevention<br>
                      - Traffic analysis
                  </p>
                  <p>These cookies are controlled by Google. You can review Google’s policies at:
                      <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cookie Policies</a>.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Streaming Providers (OpenStream & Zeno Radio)</h4>
                  <p>
                      Our live radio audio is delivered through third-party streaming services. These providers may use cookies or tracking technologies
                      to handle load balancing, analytics, or listener session information. These operate under their own policies.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Spotify Player Embeds</h4>
                  <p>
                      If you play Spotify audio embedded on our website, Spotify may set cookies for playback,
                      session management, and analytics. These are controlled by Spotify.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Social Media Links</h4>
                  <p>
                      Our pages include links to platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter).
                      Clicking these links may allow those platforms to set cookies according to their own policies.
                      However, we do not embed social media content directly on-page, so cookies are generally not set until you visit the external site.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h4>CDN & External Libraries</h4>
                  <p>
                      Technologies such as Font Awesome, Google Fonts, Bootstrap, and external JavaScript libraries
                      are loaded from CDNs. These services typically do not set cookies, but they may collect
                      basic technical data such as your IP address. This is standard and handled by their own privacy terms.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>How We Use Cookies</h3>
                  <p>
                      Because OSTM LTD does not set its own cookies, we use cookies only as a result of third-party integrations.
                      These may be used for:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      - Ensuring the radio stream loads correctly<br>
                      - Allowing Spotify embeds to function<br>
                      - Displaying Google ads (when added)<br>
                      - Measuring website usage through Google Analytics (when enabled)
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Your Choices</h3>
                  <p>
                      Because all cookies originate from third parties and not from ostm.co.uk, you can control your preferences through:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      - Google’s Ad Settings<br>
                      - Browser-level cookie controls<br>
                      - Clearing cookies and site data manually
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      When we enable Google’s cookie consent tools on the website, you will be able to manage your cookie preferences directly through Google’s banner.
                  </p>
